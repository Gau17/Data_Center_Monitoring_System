# Data_Center_Monitoring_System

Our digital world is powered by enormous server farms housed in data centers. 

Maintaining a tightly controlled environment in these facilities is essential to reduce downtime.

By providing real-time monitoring and automated temperature, humidity, and pressure controls, we can ensure a stable and efficient environment for optimal server performance and equipment longevity, as well as significant cost savings.

The proposed system provides the following benefits to data centers:
- Reduced Downtime: By proactively managing temperature and humidity, the
system can help prevent equipment failures that lead to downtime.
- Energy Efficiency: Maintaining optimal temperatures within the recommended
range allows data centers to operate their cooling systems more efficiently,
reducing energy consumption and costs.
- Predictive Maintenance: Data collected by the system can be used for predictive
maintenance. By analyzing trends in temperature and humidity readings, potential
issues can be identified and addressed before they become major problems.
